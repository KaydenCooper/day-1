        <p>My name is Kayden Cooper I was born and raised in Twin Falls, I am an early graduate of
            Twin Falls
            Highschool.
            After highschool I moved to Austin, TX where I spent the next 4 years as a barback at one of tne biggest
            clubs
            just outside of Austin.
            It was a great experience but just to far from family so thats when I decided to move back to Idaho. I spent
            about 8 months back here before going on my next adventure to Vegas,
            I spent about a year down there working at XS nightclub at the Wynn before realize being out of Idaho again
            was
            just not where I wanted to be. So I moved back again and thats when i started in the car business.
            Shortly after getting into the industry I found out I was going to have a child and little did I know how
            much
            that was going to change my life and 4 years later here I am changing careers to better life not only for me
            but
            my son as well.
